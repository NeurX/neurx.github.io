															Our ultimate goal for this project is to have a
															library for our own personal use, and something
															that we can contribute to the developing
															elixirlang community.  Each of us has projects
															that we would like to see come to fruition at the
															completion of this library.  These projects will
															hopefully be a driving force behind interative and
															continuing development on NeurX. As students, we
															have begun to understand that there is a shift in
															the way programming is being done as leveraging
															the capabilities of concurrent and distributed
															systems is now a requirements in today's
															applications.

															<h3><a>Chat Bot</a></h3>
															<p>
																Seeing how Elixir is already being used for the
																backends for many different chat applications,
																it makes sense to leverage this neural net on a
																Natural Language Processing perspective to
																create a Chat Bot.  The interfacing and useage
																is still undecided, but using it like a API
																request server, it could be linked into many
																applications like Slack, Discord, or Facebook.

															<h3><a>Image Recognition</a></h3>
															<p>
																Having NeurX being a different network model, it
																can be easier to evaluate which nodes in a
																neural network "light-up" in order to see which
																neurons have learned to recognize certain things
																in images when performing recognition.  Image
																recognition is also a very common application
																for pattern matching systems and would certainly
																put NeurX to the test!

															<h3><a>Web Crawler/Reconnaisance</a></h3>
															<p>
																With the parallelization of the web, having a
																web crawler than can run extremely concurrently
																can be invaluable when making exceptionally
																large data collection.  Processing it and
																training a neural network on the fly would be a
																simple problem to tackle for Elixir.

															<h3><a>Drone</a></h3>
															<p>
																Leveraging the data gathered from an
																accelerometer and gyrometer, the tilt could be
																fed in to receive motor velocities to train a
																drone to fly itself.  Whether or not this has a
																practical application is a question that needs
																to be answered, but it is certainly an
																interesting problem to solve.
